# Machine-Learning
Code and assignments from my machine learning class

## deep-learning.py
This assignment was to examine the CIFAR10 dataset, and create a machine learning algorithm with only three convolutional layers. From my testing, I was able to get 63-67% accuracy over five tests. I could not figure out what else to do to increase this percentage with this restriction, so this was as good as I could figure out. 

## neural.py
This assignment was to create a simple neural network that can be trained to solve neural network challenges. Specifically, our networks had to be capable of learning XOR, along with indicating if two of three inputs are on and if there were an odd number of inputs. 

## polynomial.py
This assignment was to analyze overfitting and underfitting for our neural networks. It will create data, fit curves to it, and then calculate the mean squared error. 

## datavisualization.py
This assignment was our introduction to matplotlib, where we were tasked with creating four separate graphs of data from a dataset in the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## babbler.py
This assignment was to create a very basic machine learning tool that babbles words. To do this, it analyzes a text (for my purposes, the text of Moby Dick) and then examines the chances of a letter appearing after another. It will then start writing a text, using chance to determine what the next letter the text will be. 

## python1.py
This assignment was a basic intro to python assignment, but it was interesting as it tasked me to do tasks that I normally would not do as concise as this assignment requires.
