# Machine-Learning
Code and assignments from my machine learning class

## deep-learning.py
This assignment was to examine the CIFAR10 dataset, and create a machine learning algorithm with only three convolutional layers. From my testing, I was able to get 63-67% accuracy over five tests. I could not figure out what else to do to increase this percentage with this restriction, so this was as good as I could figure out. 

## python1.py
This assignment was just a basic intro to python assignment, but it was interesting as it tasked me to do tasks that I normally would not do as concise as this assignment requires.
